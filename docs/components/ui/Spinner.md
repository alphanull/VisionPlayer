# Spinner

The Spinner component displays a "busy" animation when the player stallsâ€”typically due to an empty buffer or network-related delay. It appears with a configurable delay to avoid flickering during short interruptions. The spinner listens to player stall events as well as manually published control events.

## Configuration

Configuration example with defaults:

```javascript
const playerConfig = {
    spinner: {
        delay: 2
    }
};
```
